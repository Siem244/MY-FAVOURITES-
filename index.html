    <h2 class="h">playing soccer</h2>
    <p>
      I love how fast and dynamic the game is. It’s amazing how one moment can
      change everything, and the teamwork involved is incredible. Plus, the
      passion fans have is contagious there’s nothing quite like the energy of a
      big match!"

    <h3 class="h">coding</h3>
    <p>
      People like coding because it combines creativity, problem-solving,
      constant learning, logical thinking, and the satisfaction of building
      useful projects, while offering independence and rewarding career
      opportunities.

    <h4 class="h">playing chess</h4>
    <p>
      I like chess because it’s a game of strategy and deep thinking, where
      every move requires careful planning and foresight, offering endless
      challenges that keep the mind engaged while also providing a sense of
      accomplishment when outsmarting an opponent. Plus, it's a great way to
      improve problem-solving and critical thinking skills!
